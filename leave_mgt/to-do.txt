Creating a user-friendly dashboard to display leave-related statistics and information is a great way to enhance user experience. Here are some suggestions for the UI design and functionality:
Dashboard UI Design

    Tabbed Widget Interface:
        Use a tabbed interface to organize different sections of leave-related statistics. Each tab can represent a specific category of information.
        Example Tabs:
            Pending Requests
            Accrual History
            Leave Credits Overview
            Leave Statistics

    Pending Requests Tab:
        Display a list of pending leave requests with the following details:
            Leave type (SL, VL, SP)
            Start and end dates
            Status (Pending)
            Action buttons (e.g., "View", "Cancel", "Edit")
        Consider using a table format for clarity, with options to sort and filter requests.

    Accrual History Tab:
        Provide a summary of accrual events, showing:
            Date of accrual
            Type of accrual (Monthly or Yearly)
            Before-and-after counts of leave credits (e.g., SL and VL)
        Consider using a chart or graph to visualize accrual trends over time, making it easier for users to understand their leave accumulation.

    Leave Credits Overview Tab:
        Display the current leave credit balances for the user:
            Current Year SL Credits
            Current Year VL Credits
            Total SL Credits
            Total VL Credits
        Include a visual representation (e.g., progress bars or pie charts) to show the proportion of used vs. remaining credits.

    Leave Statistics Tab:
        Provide insights into leave usage, such as:
            Total leave taken this year
            Average leave taken per month
            Comparison of SL vs. VL usage
        Consider adding a section for upcoming leave requests or reminders.

Additional Features and Suggestions

    Notification System:
        Implement a notification system that alerts users when their leave requests are approved or rejected, or when their leave credits are updated.

    Search and Filter Options:
        Allow users to search and filter through their leave requests and accrual history by date, type of leave, and status.

    Export Options:
        Provide options for users to export their leave data (e.g., as a PDF or CSV) for personal records or reporting.

    Mobile Responsiveness:
        Ensure that the dashboard is responsive and accessible on mobile devices, allowing users to check their leave stats on the go.

    User -Friendly Design:
        Use a clean and intuitive design with clear headings, icons, and color coding to differentiate between different statuses (e.g., pending, approved, rejected).

    Help Section:
        Include a help or FAQ section that provides guidance on how to use the dashboard and understand leave policies.

Example UI Frameworks

    React: A popular library for building user interfaces, especially for dynamic and interactive dashboards.
    Bootstrap: A front-end framework that helps create responsive and mobile-first websites quickly.
    Django Templates: If you prefer to stick with Django, you can use Djangoâ€™s templating system to render the dashboard directly in your application.
