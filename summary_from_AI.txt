Leave Management System Summary (from leave_mgt.models.py)

Based on the provided code, it appears that you are developing a leave management system for employees. The system seems to be built using Django, a Python web framework. Here's a brief summary of the key components and functionality:

Key Models:

    LeaveCredits: Represents an employee's leave credits, including sick leave (SL), vacation leave (VL), and special leave (SP) credits.
    AccrualModel: An abstract base model for leave accruals, which defines the accrual value and timestamp fields.
    SL_Accrual and VL_Accrual: Concrete models that inherit from AccrualModel, representing sick leave and vacation leave accruals, respectively.
    Leave: Represents a leave request, including the employee, leave type, dates, number of days, status, and notes.

Functionality:

    Leave Accruals: The system allows for monthly leave accruals, which are calculated based on the accrual values defined in the SL_Accrual and VL_Accrual models.
    Leave Credits Management: The LeaveCredits model manages an employee's leave credits, including carrying over unused credits from the previous year.
    Leave Requests: Employees can submit leave requests, which are stored in the Leave model. The system calculates the number of days for each leave request and updates the employee's leave credits accordingly.
    Leave Status Management: The system allows for different leave statuses (e.g., pending, approved, rejected, cancelled) and updates the employee's leave credits based on the status.
    Special Leave Handling: The system has a placeholder for handling special leave credits, which is not yet implemented.

Additional Features:

    File Upload: The system allows employees to upload a form photo (with signatures) for their leave requests.
    Validation: The system performs validation on leave requests, ensuring that the start date is not greater than the end date.

Overall, this leave management system aims to streamline the process of managing employee leave requests, accruals, and credits, while providing a user-friendly interface for employees to submit and track their leave requests.
