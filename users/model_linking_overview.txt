to-do's:

salary	> multiplied ba sa 5.5 days per week ang sahod so 4 weeks = 22 days?
		> if it's date-based, I will need to get:
			- the current date,
			- add if-statements for weekdays,
			- divide user.profile.designation.get_salary_amount() by # of working days and then multiply by the # of days a certain week covers (pero parang hindi ito kaso same amounts ang pumapasok every week e)
			- multiplier for holiday rates (may need to list days 1-31 for this)
			- add marker for non-working holidays to still add count to working days*salary_per_day
